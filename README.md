# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using pygame as the drawing engine.  
The game advances to the next generation after .75 seconds.  
You can press spacebar to pause the loop and press it again to continue.  
Default grid size is 50x50 and the default pattern is a 3-period pulsar.
